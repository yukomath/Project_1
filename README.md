## Motivation

The purpose of this project is to apply the concepts learned in the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree program to a real-world dataset.  
By predicting developer salaries and analyzing feature importance, the project helps to understand which factors — such as experience, education level, country, employment type, and programming languages — most influence salary.  

It also provides a practical opportunity to explore advanced models like LightGBM and interpret model predictions using SHAP values, enhancing both technical skills and data-driven insights.
